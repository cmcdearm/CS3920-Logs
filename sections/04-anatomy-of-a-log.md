# Anatomy of a Log
Fundamentally, a log is just a record of an event, generated by a system. While logs do vary wildly 
in format and content, they often follow consistent structural patterns that make them legible by 
users or programs.
### Basic Structure of a Log Entry
Regardless of their source, most log entries contain a common set of fields:
* **Timestamp:** When the Log was recorded
* **Event Source:** Where the log was reported - what system/program recorded the event.
* **Event Description:** What happened - login pass/fail, system access, etc.
* **Severity of Log Level:** How Important is the event - CRITICAL/FATAL for breaches, INFO for expected occurences.
* **Contextual Metadata:** Any other information deemed important to include. IP address, 
NIST emphasizes that logs should include sufficient context to reconstruct events accurately 
during incident analysis.
## Common Log Formats
As mentioned before, formats can vary wildly, but are primarily split into two categories; 
**Structured** and **Unstructured**.
### Unstructured Logs (Plain Text) 
Traditional logs are written in plain text lines and are optimized for human readability.

```pgsql
2025-03-21 14:21:34 ERROR auth-service User login failed for user=cmcdearm from 192.168.1.10
```
- Formatting logs this way is easy to read, and simple to generate, but can be tedious to parse automatically.
- Additionally, without adjustment, many systems or applications can change the format, making it inconsistent [6].
### Structured Logs
Alternatively, Structured logs store data as Key-Value pairs, most commonly in formats like JSON or XML
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-21-12T14:21:34Z",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "service": "auth-service",
  "user": "cmcdearm",
  "ip": "192.168.1.10",
  "event": "login_failed"
}
```
- Key-Value pairs like this make it very machine readable, and allows for easier search and filtering. 
- Structured logs are more common in modern log management systems.
### Semi-Structured Logs
Some formats like syslog mix fixed structure and free text:
```pgsql
<34>Mar 21 14:21:34 server1 sshd[1024]: Failed password for cmcdearm from 192.168.1.10
```
- These formats try to balance readability and structure, and are widely used in operating systems and network devices [1]
## Interpreting Logs 
The first steps for interpreting logs is answering the following questions:
1. When did the event occur?
	- Check the timestamp and timezone.
2. Where did it come from?
	- Identify the host, service, or application.
3. What event happened?
	- Read the event message and error code.
4. does this matter?
	- Check the severity level and context to assess importance.
### Consistency and Design Considerations
Good logging practices aim for:
* Consistent formatting
* Clear Event messages
* Predictable severity usage
Poorly designed logs can have inconistent or missing context, making analysis significantly harder.
