There are many different types of logs, all of which cannot be covered here. Following are some general types of logs you may see.
### Application Logs
[7] Application logs are logs generated by software and pertain to events that have occurred in the software. They allow IT teams to determine the root causes of issues, identify the type of error a user may be encountering, or to track user activities.
### System Logs
[8]  System logs are generated by the operating system. All major operating systems generate system logs. They are used to see startup events, system modifications, any system errors or warnings, and system crashes among other events.
### Security Logs
[4] Security logs are generated by security monitoring systems. They are used to see any potential threats or vulnerabilities and also used to see any breach attempts or suspicious activities.
### Network Logs
[4] Network logs are generated by network devices. They are a log of network traffic, network performance, and can be used for security purposes to detect or root out an attacker.
### Audit Logs
[9] Audit logs are logs on system infrastructure changes. They log what type of change was made, who made it, when it was done, and the effects of the action. They are for logging user actions, not system actions.
### Database Logs
